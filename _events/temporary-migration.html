Join Peter Mares as he discusses his book Not Quite Australian - How Temporary Migration is Changing the Nation, which draws on case studies, interviews and personal stories to investigate the complex realities of this new era of temporary migration. <br />
<br />
Peter Mares is the author of the award-winning book Borderline: Australia’s Response to Refugees and Asylum Seekers in the Wake of the Tampa and has written about migration for many media outlets including the Age, Australian Financial Review and Griffith Review.<br />
<br />
Praise for Peter Mares and Not Quite Australian:
'Mares has once again presented a controversial and complicated topic with clarity and humanity. At a time when a national conversation about what it means to be Australian (or unAustralian) seems daily social media fodder, Not Quite Australian is an important contribution. And a reminder of the importance of thorough, slow-burn journalism in the hot-takes age.’ - Big Issue<br />
<br />
'An important and timely contribution to the debate about how Australia should handle the migration of people to its territory, and I highly recommend it.' - Australian Book Review

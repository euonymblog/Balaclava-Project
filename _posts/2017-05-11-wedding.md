My partner and I got married last month and we made it as Balaclava a wedding as we could. Here’s a shout out to all the local businesses that were involved.  <br>
  <br>
#### The Venue/Dinner ####
  <br>
We had the ceremony and dinner at [Ilona Staller](http://ilonastaller.com.au/). We booked the function room for dinner  and as it was a Monday, we were also able to use the lounge area for the ceremony. The function team could not have been more helpful as we planned the event, responding quickly when I had questions and dealing with unforeseen things on the day with no fuss. A special shout out to Ben who looked after us on the night and made it all go like clockwork.  <br>
  <br>
### The Accessories ###
  <br>
  I bought my clutch at [Carlisle Accessories](http://www.carlisleaccessories.com.au/). Again, they couldn’t have been more helpful, browsing through the catalogue with me while I tried to choose the one that would go best, ordering it for me as well as persuading the company to sent just one bag (usually they had a minimum order) and then letting me know when it had arrived. So when we needed to get a wedding ring for my husband, we knew where to go. And when the ring we bought the morning of the wedding turned out to be too big, they exchanged it with no fuss at all.  <br>
  <br>
### The Flowers ###
  <br>
  Dom and his sister from [Big on Flowers](http://www.bigonflowers.com.au/) did us proud. I asked for something full of Australian natives and quite natural. The bouquet and buttonhole were lovely and as I sit here a month on, I still have the gum nuts and the yellow ones in a vase to remind me of a very special day.  <br>
    <br>
### The Hair and Makeup ###
  <br>
I had a manicure/pedicure at [Golden Nails](http://golden.aussiesalon.com/) a few days before the wedding. On the afternoon of the wedding, Antoinette from [ABProlab](http://abprolab.com.au/) came in on her day off to make me look respectable. She totally got the look I wanted, keeping it natural and slightly retro, in line with my 1950s style dress, without making me look like I was going to a fancy dress party.  <br>
  <br>
### The Tailor   ###
  <br>
My dress needed a bit of alteration and I had that done at [E&L Clothing Alterations](https://www.yellowpages.com.au/vic/st-kilda-east/e-l-clothing-alterations-12935556-listing.html). It was done on time and with no fuss at all.

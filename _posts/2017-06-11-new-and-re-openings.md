It’s been good to see some new places opening up on Carlisle Street – and the return of an old favourite.

Fresh Food Corner is an Eastern European-style butcher and deli. They have plain meats, prepared dishes like schnitzels, satays and marinated chicken, plus deli meats and pickled/smoked fish. They have jars of sauerkraut and beetroot and various other European delicacies. They closed for renovations shortly before Christmas, ostensibly for 2 weeks, but only re-opened again last week. It’s so good for the area to have a proper food shop in that space. Glad to see you back, guys!

We have a new addition too – the Balaclava Fruit Shop has opened in the old Baker in the Rye space. I bought veg in there today and the lady who served me was very nice. Again, I’m just so glad that it’s a produce shop that can keep Carlisle as a proper shopping street.

And there’s a new bar, Ms Carlisle’s, where the Carlisle Wine Bar was. They seem to do wine and cheese, as well as soup and things. On the list of places to try.

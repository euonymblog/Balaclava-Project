I have a soft spot for this place, because we got married here last year. Or did we get married here because we had a soft spot for it? Maybe I should explain.

When J and I decided to get hitched, we knew we wanted it to be local. We were going to rent a room at the town hall for the celebration and then take our guests for dinner somewhere nice. So *of course*&nbsp;we had to try out a few of the higher end local establishments. We came to Ilona Staller on a Sunday and had a really lovely meal. The food was good (always the first point), the staff were friendly, the atmosphere was relaxed and the wine list had several of our favourites on it. We realised then that the additional charge for hiring the function room would be less than the cost of a room at the town hall, and once we saw the gorgeous mid-century modernist space upstairs, we were sold. And then there was the day with the $2 oysters...

So to sum up, great for lunch (they do a very reasonable lunch special, with a glass of wine), great for functions, strong wine list, inCREDible desserts, delightful staff.&nbsp;

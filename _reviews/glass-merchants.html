I first came here just before Christmas, when the place we wanted to go for dinner was closed for a private party and we had nothing in the house. It was quiet that evening – we were just about the only people in – but we had a lovely dinner: cauliflower and blue cheese arancini followed by big juicy steaks, all washed down with pints of Nail Ale. But from following them on Instagram it seemed that breakfast was much more their thing. We got a chance to put that to the test this morning. <br />
<br />
The venue – an old glass factory, as the name suggests – has  vestiges of its previous life here and there (“that’s an old band-saw”, said my partner J, the former engineer). Tables and booths seem to have been made with the tools lying around, giving it a nice air of DIY meets industrial chic without being too contrived. The coffees were small (they don’t serve large) but very good, with the Five Senses blend well served by whoever was behind the machine. I can’t eat poached or fried eggs, so was happy to see a menu with a lot of non-egg choices. I went for a hash-brown topped with ocean trout (pictured above), with smatterings of other flavours on the plate including beautifully sweet roasted cherry tomatoes and some pickled beetroot that was clearly not out of a jar.  J had a breakfast bun with egg and pastrami. <br />
<br />
The place was buzzing, but not frenetic. There is a lot of seating that is well organised to not feel full even when busy. I got a kick out of seeing two little boys playing on a space invaders machine that looked like it was built when I was their age (i.e. a long time ago!). Service was efficient and certainly friendly. <br />
<br />
Over our meal we talked about other local places we hadn’t yet been to, given we are new to the area and J said something along the lines of “but will we need to go there now that we have found this place?” Difficult to find a better compliment, I would say. <br />
<br />
UPDATE: We've been back a couple of times since I wrote this review and it hasn't lived up to the first couple of times, hence the three stars. But J got a coffee from there recently and it was much better, so we might give it another go soon.

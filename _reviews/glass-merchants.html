This place seems to have had its ups and downs recently. When we first arrived in Balaclava, we came here quite a bit and loved it. There's a particular lamb and couscous salad one lunchtime that still lingers in my memory. But then the French cook left and things weren't the same for quite a while. With other great places opening in the area, it fell right down the list. THen J ended up getting a coffee in there one morning when nothing else was opening and reported something of a return to form. So we decided to give it another go.<br />
<br />
The venue – an old glass factory, as the name suggests – has  vestiges of its previous life here and there (“that’s an old band-saw”, said J, the former engineer). Tables and booths seem to have been made with the tools lying around, giving it a nice air of DIY meets industrial chic without being too contrived. The coffee was definitely good and they now serve a big mug, which they didn't before. I had the green scrambled eggs, which had chili and feta and were very tasty. J had a special, a croquette with chorizo and a delicious sauce on the side. <br />
<br />
The service was friendly, the food was good, the coffee was better and the price was certainly around par for what we had. It's a very pleasant venue, and we're both really pleased that somewhere that had been a bit of a favourite has got its game face back on.

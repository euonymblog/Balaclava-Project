I visited Vietnam for the first time in 2015. One of my best friends lives in Ho Chi Minh City and it was a useful place to break my journey to Europe (plus Vietnam Airlines is quite a cheap option!). I spent a few days in Hanoi and then went down to HCMC. In both spots, a priority was to get out and eat proper Vietnamese food. I had a wonderful time there and ate really well. Of course even before going, I'd tried some of the excellent Vietnamese food Melbourne had to offer. From grilled lemongrass chicken to pork rolls wrapped in lettuce leaves to barbecued sparrows (a little language problem with that one), I haven't really had anything I don't like. But the best thing about Vietnamese food is unquestionably a good beef pho. As every cookery programme tells you, the secret is always in the broth, which needs to be deeply flavoured and rich.

&nbsp;

The best pho I have had in Melbourne is undoubtedly at Saigon Street Eats. The broth in particular is heavenly, a complex blend of marrow and spices and beef. I definitely get a strong licorice/star anise flavour from it, but that's just one element. The first time I had it, I just wanted to drink it. So imagine my pleasure when I realised they sell it in cups, so you can, literally, drink it. I have also had the green papaya salad, once with chicken and once with tofu, and they were both delicious, their tangy acidity providing a good foil to the richness of the pho.

&nbsp;

For me, Saigon Street Eats is one of the unsung food heroes of Carlisle Street - excellent food at a very reasonable price. And isn't that the best combo?!

I'll just get this out there - I don't like chai. A cafe at uni once gave my flat white to someone and gave me her chai latte and after one sip, I was pretty revolted. I don't like milk much, for starters, and then the spices just seemed so sickly. Bleagh.

&nbsp;

But then I got given a book called [Erotic Stories for Punjabi Widows](https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062645128/erotic-stories-for-punjabi-widows) for my birthday. It's an interesting read - it seems quite fluffy, but it actually has some interesting things to say about community and adaptation and the struggle for second- and third-generation immigrants. Much of the book is set in Southall, an area of London that is the centre of the Punjabi community, and the various characters were always making chai. The idea of tea and spices seemed like something I would like, but I wasn't really sure where to start making it myself. So when we walked past the shopfront that was until recently Finn and saw that an Indian place was opening, which advertised chai and was actually called Southall, well, I knew I was going to have to give it a go.

&nbsp;

I went for breakfast this morning. I had Akuri, an absolutely delicious dish of spiced scrambled eggs. The spice profile was very subtle, almost floral and although the serving looked quite small when it arrived, it was pretty substantial. I also ordered the Masala Chai, which was seemed to be the drink I had been reading about, and it was just as good as I had hoped. The spices were fresh (hadn't sat around in a tin as powder) and the dominant flavour was actually tea (rather than being "like drinking an incense stick" as the owner described chai latte to me).&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was only afterwards, looking for information for this page, that I found out that Southall is run by Melbourne restaurant royalty, the former owners of Bombay by Night. That surely says something about the growing foodie profile of our little corner of Melbourne. I'm very much looking forward to exploring their breakfast, lunch and dinner (starting next week) menus and I'm delighted they've come to spice up (b'dum tish) Balaclava.

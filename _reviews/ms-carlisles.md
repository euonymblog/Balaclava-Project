Ms Carlisle's is a new addition to Carlisle Street, having moved into what was until recently the Carlisle Wine Bar. I'm not sure what the story was, and I never actually visited the previous place, but the turn-around seemed to happen quite quickly. Anyway, we decided to give it a go for a Sunday brunch.&nbsp;

The menu was fairly standard Melbourne breakfast options - smashed avo, eggs benedict, pancakes. I had green fritters with halloumi and J had the big breakfast. His biggest gripe was that it came on a board, rather than a proper plate, which made eating it somewhat challenging. However he said the quality of the ingredients was high and the home-made baked beans were absolutely delicious. My fritters were more like pancakes, but tasty for all that and who doesn't like squeaky cheese?! I had a very decent coffee to start with and was impressed that when I asked for a Bloody Mary they made me one, even though it wasn't on the menu. I had a peek at their wine-list and it seemed to have some good options on there at pretty reasonable prices. We're planning an evening of the charcuterie and cheese washed down with a Nero d'Avola and I'll let you know what that's like!

When I first moved to Balaclava, one of my regular coffee joints was Cafe Monkey, a little space on Chapel Street that churned out great coffee and always had a queue of council staff and police queuing up for their lattes. When they closed, I wasn't sure where I was going to go that was so near to the house and served such good quality. So it was a relief when Monkey was replaced by another coffee place. And then the joy was doubled by finding out it had a Nordic vibe. &nbsp;I spent part of my childhood in Finland, so rye bread, pea soup, cinnamon rolls and that delicious salty kalles kaviar transport me back immediately. Luckily Nord serve all of the above, plus the best coffee in the hood (for my money). Luke and Anna are lovely - it's so great having a coffee place where you get a smile, a friendly hello and someone who is interested in what you are up to. My absolutely favourite thing is the Swedish breakfast, a little pot of yoghurt with homemade granola and fresh fruit, plus rye bread with avocado and boiled eggs and, if you're feeling up to it, a squeeze of kalles kaviar on the side. Add in their range of soups and salads, plus Anna's wonderful home baked goodies and you have coffee run perfection.&nbsp;

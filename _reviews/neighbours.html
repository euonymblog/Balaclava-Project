It can be quite stressful, moving. There’s all the hassle of physically getting your stuff from one place to another. There’s the dealing with utilities, which is enough to try the patience of a saint even when it goes well (and I’m going to spare you the whole Optus story – suffice it to say they aren’t getting my custom). And then there are the more intangible things, like having to change your friendly local cafe. I had a great place in Brunswick – seriously good coffee, solid hearty food, lovely staff and (important for a student) free wifi. I’ve tried a few places since I arrived in Balaclava – reviews to come – but none felt close to filling that particular gap in my life. Until today.<br />
<br />
Neighbours cafe nestles on the corner of Chapel Street and Inkerman Street. It’s at the wilderness end of Chapel Street, none of the buzz of Windsor or the retail therapy of Prahran, instead rather residential. It’s also slightly away from the Carlisle Street precinct. So really you have to know it’s there.<br />

When you walk in, you immediately get the feeling that this is going to be a good experience. The cafe area is open and uncrowded, with a huge espresso machine and a direct view through to the seating area, which seems very enticing. Which it certainly is, opening onto a lovely walled garden, with shaded area, lots of seating including a large communal table and a sign indicating that dogs are welcome. The menu is fairly standard Melbourne breakfast fare, though as an egg-allergy sufferer, I was glad to see that eggs are an optional extra on several of the dishes. I had the heirloom tomatoes and avocado on multigrain bread with goats cheese and it was delicious, definitely enlivened by a few key herbs and micro-leaves on top. The coffee was strong and flavourful, the staff friendly. And best of all, they have wifi.

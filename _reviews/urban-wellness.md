I was walking down Chapel Street a couple of weeks ago, when I had the most lovely surprise: a new place has opened up down towards the Parcel Office that has flotation tanks! When I lived in London, floating was my absolutely favourite form of relaxation and wellbeing. I hadn’t done one since I moved to Australia and so was very excited about the chance of doing it again. And today was the perfect occasion – I’ve just spent five days in Sydney delivering a really high-level conference. The tension beforehand and the full-on nature of the event itself meant I was in dire need of some relaxation therapy! So I headed along to Urban this afternoon.

The tank was slightly different to how I had done before and I suppose could be a little confronting for a first timer – it looks a little bit like an escape pod in a sci-fi film. But I hopped right in, shut the tank and started floating. There is an option of a light, and the whale-noise style music is calming as you start off. But if you relax into it, it’s like an hour lying on the most comfortable bed you’ll ever find. At the end of it, the music comes back on. I’m not sure if I had fallen asleep or was just in that sort of twilight snoozing thing, but I felt very woozy as I got out of the tank and was happy for all the handles around the room! Then a shower in one of the best showers I’ve ever experienced, with lovely Sukin products and I was ready to go. I headed out and had a glass of coconut water and chatted to the people there while I came back to normality.

I’m looking forward to a decent night’s sleep tonight and I’m pretty sure I’ll be back at Urban before too long!
